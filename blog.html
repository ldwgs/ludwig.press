		    It's pretty late, or maybe its a little early, for me to be reflecting on this year. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the things i'd like to get done this year, or some of the things that i'm looking forward to doing. <br> <br>
				March will embark my 3rd and final year of university. I'm excited to go back though, i'm curious to see the subjects they'll be teaching within the respective courses. From the summaries, it seems more 'Computer Science' -y subjects like 'The Study of Algorithms and how they Affect your Program' and such. <br>
				Very exciting stuff, i know. <br> <br>
				It is actually pretty exciting stuff, i'd like to see what else i'm going to be able to implement into my personal projects <br>
				I should really be practicing Java and C again before going back, i would expect my skills to be a little rusty <br>
				But web development has been such a blast and i cant seem to divide my attention to anything else. <br> <br>

				<i><span style="font-size:17px">"lel web development isnt real programming"</span></i> <br> <br>

				I dont know if i want to drop Chinese though. <br>
				I really love the subject and its really fun. <br>
				I took it as a subject for me to just chill out and not have to think about more efficient sorting algorithms during my 1st year. <br>
				I'm still contemplating on dropping and just focusing on my 3rd year computing classes as they seem more difficult. <br>
				Plus, its super expensive to just let it be a 'fluke subject' <br>
				I was thinking about not enrolling but still going to the classes every now and again. <br>
				I'm pretty sure <span style="color:#DE2910">老师</span> wont mind. <br>
				We'll see though. <br> <br>

				Em, other things i'm looking forward to this year. <br>
				Well, obviously going back to <img src="nz-flag.png" alt="ludwig.press" width="4%"> is pretty exciting. <br>
				I'm planning on getting a part-time job as a Web Developer when i'm back there. <br>
				Would really love to learn more and persue it as a career and i think where i'm living is a pretty dense place for those. <br>
				We'll see though, obviously, i need to be accepted first. <br>
				Just want to build my portfolio up and hopefully spring for a full time position after i graduate. <br>
				I need to be better than the competiton though, so i'm working on my skillset now and hopefully i can prove my worth. <br> <br>

				<span style="font-size:40px;color:#B22222">Adult</span> <br> <br>

				3.20pm right now in Malaysia and I still havent eaten a meal yet. I've got get that sorted. <br>
				Meanwhile, please enjoy this picture i took from my dinner at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/zjsxhod" target="_blank" style="color:#F8D352">Johnny Rockets</a> last night. <br>
				It was hella good. <br>
				I had never eaten there before and the meal was super delicious. <br>
				Either that, or im hyping it up cause i am/was super hungry. <br>
				¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br> <br>

				I came across a new text editor called <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" style="color:#72ACAB">Atom</a> . <br>
				It's pretty good. I was using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank" style="color:#E67E22">Sublime Text 3</a> before but I didn't like how it was quite bare-boned. <br> <br>
				Anyways, I had been intrigued since picking up Web Development and was going around all of my usual websites to check out their source codes and comparing them to mine to see how they differ. <br>
				I had seen some more 'sophisticated' source codes and was wondering if what I was doing was pretty 'low class'. <br>
				But apparently, not the case! <br>
				Below is a code snippet of what I took from <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" style="color:#72ACAB">Atom.io</a> <br> <br>

				<div style="height:300px;font:13px;overflow:auto">

<div class="wrapper features">
<div class="one-o-feature">
<div class="feature-circle">
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-file-code"></span>
</div>
<h4>File system browser</h4>
<p>Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-o-feature">
<div class="feature-circle">
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-mirror"></span>
</div>
<h4>Multiple panes</h4>
<p>Split your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-o-feature">
<div class="feature-circle">
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-search"></span>
</div>
<h4>Find and replace</h4>
<p>Find, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
				</xmp>

			If you compare that to mine, it seems quite similar. I just have far less classes for my divs and such. <br>
			I don't know, I thought that was pretty cool. <br>
			I still have a lot to learn though. Would love to learn and implement some other front-end dev languages such as <br><span style="color:#58379F">PHP</span> , <span style="color:#F0DB4F">JavaScript</span> and <span style="color:#CC0000">Ruby</span> . <br> <br>
			Obviously there are plenty more languages to learn and implement, but those 3 are what I would like to take up as of right now. The functions seem pretty cool and I think it can help me make my website a little more interesting and efficient. <br>
			Like, I saw on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4642681/simple-way-to-display-data-in-a-txt-file-on-a-webpage" target="_blank" style="color:#F48024">Stack Overflow</a> that you can display contents of a file onto the screen using <span style="color:#58379F">PHP</span> . <br>
			That's pretty cool, considering I'm just typing text for my headings and paragraphs on  a text editor, worrying if ya'll will catch my spelling errors. <br> <br>

				Is this working? <br> <br>
				Hello? <br> <br>
				This might actually be working. <br> <br>
				Well for the 2 people in the audience reading this, I greatly welcome you and thank you for taking the time to read and visit my site. <br>
				For the Developers out there, please do not read my sour-. Actually, do read my source code. And suggest what I should do to my site to improve it.
				Whether it be writing styles or functions or anything else, I would be more than happy to take it into consideration.
				I'm really loving web development and would like to know some other things I should do to improve myself. <br> <br>
				If you aren't a developer but you also have a suggestion, you can reach me through my social media links on the bottom of the page or visit my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lameludwig" target="_blank" style="color:#4099FF">here</a> or instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/ldwgs" target="_blank" style="color:#bc2a8d">here</a> . <br> <br>
				Em ...... What else? <br> <br>
				I guess that's pretty much it. <br> <br>
				I'm trying to learn more about web development because I really enjoy it. Excited to see what else I can put on here and the many wonders of front-end development.
				And also the stories I'm planning on posting here on my blog. (p.s. I don't leave the house much) <br> <br>
				Alas, I bid you all farewell (for the time being). <br> <br>
