				Been like, what? <br>
				A little more than 2 weeks since I last posted here? <br>
				Nothing much has really happened, just been focusing on going back to uni and starting my final year of my degree. <br>
				I have to go back to Java which is PRETTY FUN B O Y S <br>
				Endless nights of trying to figure out why my functions aren't returning what I need. <br> <br>

				Extremely fun. <br> <br>

				Though, I should blame that on my stupidity more than the compiler and the syntax or even the Java documentation. <br>
				Web Development is so much more fun by contrast. <br> <br>

				Speaking of which, I've made a couple of changes to my website that will make it easier to navigate through. <br>
				I've added a 'back-to-top' widget <img src="images/back-to-top-arrow.png" alt="ludwig.press" height="2%" width="2%"/> that allows users to ... go back to the top of the page. <br>
				It's only vacant on this page because this is the only page thus far that has significant content that allows for a lot of scrolling. <br>
				You could press 'Page Up' on your keyboard for the same effect, but cmon, who has full sized keyboards nowadays? <br> <br>

				Another thing that I implemented into my site are metatags. <br>
				I'm not exactly sure what they are, but to my understanding, they pretty much describe the kind of content that is in a particular website. <br>
				This makes it easier for people to search for your site through search engines and you can tailor your tags in a process called 'Search Engine Optimization' <br> <br>

				I've created a couple of tags just to test it out and to see if people can find my site through a search engine. <br>
				Since they couldn't find my site before through a search engine, that technically makes my site part of the Deep Web. <br> <br>

				SO THAT'S PRETTY COOL I GUESS. <br> <br>

				What else? <br> <br>

				I'm trying to get back into Java as I think I'm pretty rusty and maybe some <span style="color:#339BFF">C</span> as well because I'll be using it when I go back to university. <br>
				<span style="color:#339BFF">C</span> is pretty cool, it's a familiar face as my first programming language is <span style="color:#662E93">C</span>. <br>
				But needing to program in the context of memory bandwidth, efficiency and allocation and drops, is pretty tedious to be honest. <br> <br>

				TIS' THE JOYS OF PROGRAMMING <br>
				It's always satisfying and worth it when you end up creating something from nothing. <br>

		    So little time - <span style="color:#F9E3CB; font-size:20px">Jan 21, 2017</span>
		  </h1>
		  <h2 class="h2-posts">
				I've been researching a little more about Web Development and what it takes to be a 'good' Web Developer. <br>
				But with any type of Computer Programming, you have to realise your skill set and <br>what you enjoy doing most or what aspects of programming you're good at. <br>
				So let's break it down. <br> <br>
				In programming, there's 3 types of developers. <br>
				There are <span style="color:#F1DD3F">Front-End Developers</span>, <span style="color:#8E2031">Back-End Developers</span> and the godly <span style="color:#0B7859">Full-Stack Developers</span> <br> <br>

				<span style="color:#F1DD3F;font-size:30px">Front-End Developers -</span> <br> <br>
				<img src="images/front-end.jpg" alt="ludwig.press"/> <br>
				<i><span style="font-size:14px">Source: <a href="http://www.favicondigital.com/front-and-back-end-web-development.html" target="_blank">favicondigital.com</span></i></a> <br> <br>
				These types of developers are responsible for making the website or product 'look pretty'. <br>
				Anything from fonts, color combinations, medias, UI, UX and everything else, they're the people behind it. <br>
				They work closely with designers to create ideas of marrying a clean interface with a functional one. <br> <br>
				To be honest, it's a lot easier said than done. <br> <br>
				I've seen wayyy too many 'one page websites' or 'uber xtreme LEL ALL THE medias play all at once NGNGNGNGNNG' websites thinking that it will run as well online as it did locally. <br>
				Like, no dude. <br> <br>
				For the people who don't have gigabit internet, its going to look choppy as hell. <br>
				Which makes me want to leave. <br>
				So it's more complicated than it sounds. <br> <br>

				<span style="color:#8E2031;font-size:30px">Back-End Developers -</span> <br> <br>
				<img src="images/back-end.jpg" alt="ludwig.press"/> <br>
				<i><span style="font-size:14px">Source: <a href="http://www.favicondigital.com/front-and-back-end-web-development.html" target="_blank">favicondigital.com</span></i></a> <br> <br>
				Back-End developers are responsible for the data that gets transmitted and stored from and to the website. <br>
				They are responsible for managing the back-end of the website. <br>
				These consist of a server, an application and a database. <br>
				These three aspects are what give the website and pages life and content. <br> <br>

				The languages associated with being a Back-End developer consists of server-side languages such as <br> <span style="color:#3A205E">PHP</span>, <span style="color:#A81401">Ruby</span>, <span style="color:#FECE26">Python</span>, <span style="color:#E76F00">Java</span> and <span style="color:#1A71A3">.NET</span> for the application.<br>
				As well as tools like <span style="color:#134E61">MySQL</span>, <span style="color:#ED3237">Oracle</span> and <span style="color:#DC3B00">SQL Server</span> to find/save/change data and <br>serve it back to the user in front-end code. <br>
				There are a whole host of other frameworks and control software like <span style="color:#F05033">Git</span> that <br> back-end developers need to be able to master. <br> <br>
				All of this in combination, is the reason why users can navigate around <br> websites and see content on their screen. <br>
				The reason why you log into your account on a website or program or app and it loads all of your saved files is all because of the work of Back-End Developers. <br> <br>

				And finally, <br> <br>

				<span style="color:#F1DD3F;font-size:30px">Full-Stack Developers -</span> <br> <br>
				<img src="images/full-stack.jpg" alt="ludwig.press"/> <br>
				<i><span style="font-size:14px">Source: <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">sitepoint.com</span></i></a> <br> <br>
				Full-Stack developers are insane. <br>
				They are literally a one-person team. <br>
				They have both the skills of a front-end developer and a back-end developer. <br>
				They are able to create and stabalise the back-end technologies of the product and also create and design a aesthetically pleasing product whilst also being able to deliver a satisfying experience, and then some. <br>
				But to be honest, nowadays, it isn't that hard to be somewhat of a Full-Stack developer. <br>
				Hell, I created this entire website from scratch, designed it, enabled it on a hosting platform. <br>
				So ... I'm technically a Full-Stack developer. <br>
				(not really) <br> <br>

				But yeah, that's pretty much the 3 types of developers. <br>
				I wish I had more free time to play around with some more Front-End and also Back-End programming languages and implement them into my personal projects. <br>
				I'm slowly starting to realise its almost the end of my summer break. <br> <br>
				There never seems to be enough time.

				It's pretty late, or maybe its a little early, for me to be reflecting on this year. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the things I'd like to get done this year, or some of the things that I'm looking forward to doing. <br> <br>
				March will embark my 3rd and final year of university. I'm excited to go back though, I'm curious to see the subjects they'll be teaching within the respective courses. From the summaries, it seems more 'Computer Science' -y subjects like 'The Study of Algorithms and how they Affect your Program' and such. <br>
				Very exciting stuff, I know. <br> <br>
				It is actually pretty exciting stuff, I'd like to see what else I'm going to be able to implement into my personal projects <br>
				I should really be practicing Java and C again before going back, I would expect my skills to be a little rusty <br>
				But web development has been such a blast and I can't seem to divide my attention to anything else. <br> <br>

				<i><span style="font-size:17px">"lel web development isnt real programming"</span></i> <br> <br>

				I don't know if I want to drop Chinese though. <br>
				I really love the subject and its really fun. <br>
				I took it as a subject for me to just chill out and not have to think about more efficient sorting algorithms during my 1st year. <br>
				I'm still contemplating on dropping and just focusing on my 3rd year computing classes as they seem more difficult. <br>
				Plus, its super expensive to just let it be a 'fluke subject' <br>
				I was thinking about not enrolling but still going to the classes every now and again. <br>
				I'm pretty sure <span style="color:#DE2910">&#32769;&#24072;</span> wont mind. <br>
				We'll see though. <br> <br>

				Em, other things I'm looking forward to this year. <br>
				Well, obviously going back to <img src="images/nz-flag.png" alt="ludwig.press" width="4%"> is pretty exciting. <br>
				I'm planning on getting a part-time job as a Web Developer when I'm back there. <br>
				Would really love to learn more and pursue it as a career and I think where I'm living is a pretty dense place for those. <br>
				We'll see though, obviously, I need to be accepted first. <br>
				Just want to build my portfolio up and hopefully spring for a full time position after I graduate. <br>
				I need to be better than the competition though, so I'm working on my skill set now and hopefully I can prove my worth. <br> <br>

				<span style="font-size:40px;color:#B22222">Adult</span> <br> <br>

				3.20pm right now in Malaysia and I still haven't eaten a meal yet. I've got to get that sorted. <br>
				Meanwhile, please enjoy this picture I took from my dinner at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/zjsxhod" target="_blank" style="color:#F8D352">Johnny Rockets</a> last night. <br>
				It was hella good. <br>
				I had never eaten there before and the meal was super delicious. <br>
				Either that, or im hyping it up cause I am/was super hungry. <br>

				Doing something right - <span style="color:#669966; font-size:20px">Jan 17, 2017</span>

			<h2 class="h2-posts">
				I came across a new text editor called <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" style="color:#72ACAB">Atom</a> . <br>
				It's pretty good. I was using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank" style="color:#E67E22">Sublime Text 3</a> before but I didn't like how it was quite bare-boned. <br> <br>
				Anyways, I had been intrigued since picking up Web Development and was going around all of my usual websites to check out their source codes and comparing them to mine to see how they differ. <br>
				I had seen some more 'sophisticated' source codes and was wondering if what I was doing was pretty 'low class'. <br>
				But apparently, not the case! <br>
				Below is a code snippet of what I took from <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" style="color:#72ACAB">Atom.io</a> <br> <br>

				<div style="height:300px;font:13px;overflow:auto">
				<xmp>
<div class="wrapper features">
<div class="one-o-feature">
<div class="feature-circle">
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-file-code"></span>
</div>
<h4>File system browser</h4>
<p>Easily browse and open a single file, a whole project, or multiple projects in one window.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-o-feature">
<div class="feature-circle">
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-mirror"></span>
</div>
<h4>Multiple panes</h4>
<p>Split your Atom interface into multiple panes to compare and edit code across files.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-o-feature">
<div class="feature-circle">
<span class="mega-octicon octicon-search"></span>
</div>
<h4>Find and replace</h4>
<p>Find, preview, and replace text as you type in a file or across all your projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
				</xmp>
			</div>

			<br> <br>
			If you compare that to mine, it seems quite similar. I just have far less classes for my divs and such. <br>
			I don't know, I thought that was pretty cool. <br>
			I still have a lot to learn though. Would love to learn and implement some other front-end dev languages such as <br><span style="color:#58379F">PHP</span> , <span style="color:#F0DB4F">JavaScript</span> and <span style="color:#CC0000">Ruby</span> . <br> <br>
			Obviously there are plenty more languages to learn and implement, but those 3 are what I would like to take up as of right now. The functions seem pretty cool and I think it can help me make my website a little more interesting and efficient. <br>
			Like, I saw on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4642681/simple-way-to-display-data-in-a-txt-file-on-a-webpage" target="_blank" style="color:#F48024">Stack Overflow</a> that you can display contents of a file onto the screen using <span style="color:#58379F">PHP</span> . <br>
			That's pretty cool, considering I'm just typing text for my headings and paragraphs on  a text editor, worrying if ya'll will catch my spelling errors. <br> <br>

				Is this working? <br> <br>
				Hello? <br> <br>
				This might actually be working. <br> <br>
				Well for the 2 people in the audience reading this,<br> I greatly welcome you and thank you for taking the time to read and visit my site. <br> <br>
				For the Developers out there, please do not read my sour-. Actually, do read my source code. And suggest what I should do to my site to improve it.
				Whether it be writing styles or functions or anything else, I would be more than happy to take it into consideration.
				I'm really loving web development and would like to know some other things I should do to improve myself. <br> <br>
				If you aren't a developer but you also have a suggestion, you can reach me through my social media links on the bottom of the page or visit my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lameludwig" target="_blank" style="color:#4099FF">here</a> or instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/ludwig.press" target="_blank" style="color:#bc2a8d">here</a> . <br> <br>
				Em ...... What else? <br> <br>
				I guess that's pretty much it. <br> <br>
				I'm trying to learn more about web development because I really enjoy it. Excited to see what else I can put on here and the many wonders of front-end development.
				And also the stories I'm planning on posting here on my blog. (p.s. I don't leave the house much) <br> <br>
				Alas, I bid you all farewell (for the time being). <br> <br>
