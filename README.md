- daaaaaaaaaaaaang. this entry is from my desktop. i have learnt how to push and pull repositories so that my projects are all up to date on all of my devices. this is actually really cool. i can seriously jump out of my workstation whenever im working on a problem, bring my laptop with me for a walk or drive, and then get back to work as soon as i think of a fresh solution. pretty excited to see what lies ahead. i consider this quite a stepping stone in good development. 
- sweet, it is. i was fumbling around trying to link up GitHub with Atom on OSX and it finally works. i can now have the freedom of working on my projects both portably and not. i have the freedom of stretching my legs away from my workstation and bringing my laptop to a park or coffee shop or something and resume as if nothing has happened. this is all preparation for a car service that is overdue that i have to go around doing today. at least then i feel like im being productive. its 12.25am right now and i can rest easy knowing that i have everything sorted. feelsgoodman.
- is this working??

17 Jan 2017 - I should really put in some notes for future self to reflect upon. So I'll start off here, 3 days or so after publishing this repo. The topest of kek.
- modified .htaccess file because it gave the website a 404 error. commented out the bad code and replaced it with another string of text. website is up again.
- included .htaccess file which helps to make the address bar links to .HTML and .PHP files look cleaner. So instead of ludwig.press/index.html , it is now ludwig.press/index
- made another blog entry
- was tinkering around new divs for the separation on paragraphs both on the contacts page and also the blog page. Trying to get the contact page to align correctly, but it seems like that's a little tough as of right now. I'll give it another try. But the separations for the blog page seems to be working as intended. Would like to see how it looks on mobile though.

First commit before 17 Jan 2017 -
- from memory, I can recall that I obviously published the site and uploaded all of the scripts and relevant files and images onto GitHub.
- in the days following first commit, I remember inputting content in all of the pages.
- I did remove the project page link though, needs more tinkering with linking my developer page and making it look 'pretty' or aesthetically pleasing and maybe a demo (if possible), before putting it up online.
- I also aligned the content on the index, blog and contact page so that it looks nice and neat. Before, it was pretty much all over the place and looks good only on my computer screen. Now, it looks better on both mobile and desktops, of all resolutions.
