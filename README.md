- test
- i also fixed the Git push, pull and commit commands on Atom. The error was that there were local files that contradict the ones that were on GitHub, so i needed to either move the local files or remove them and then pull straight from GitHub and then finally, commit all and push back. Uhhh, that was exactly what i did by the way. And it worked! Praise Gaben.
- added a new blog post just explaining a little bit about front-end, back-end and full-stack developers. its all quite interesting. but i think that it's better to have a team you can rely on and get feedback and fresh ideas from rather than having a single linear biased vision of how a product should look. when people say 'when there are too many chefs in the kitchen, the food could end up tasting bad'. i disagree with that. i think that its healthy to have various inputs from your team members or even just a second opinion to show that there are other aspects or elements that might have been overlooked. it could end up creating an even better product.

- added a blog post. engh, need to eat. this cup of tea is barely giving me enough energy.
- wondering if the linking to other elements of the web upon my website is a little unstable. i think its fine for things that need proper hosting like music and whatnot. medias like pictures might be a little unstable to keep linking from the web. its much safer to save the picture and link it in the directory of my public_html folder. because if i link a picture from the web, the source might be down and it'll push out a blank image. which isnt desirable most times.

- added a blog post. played around with embedding items from the web. included 2 songs that i came across and edited a little bit of the embedding string to fit into my layout. the emebedding link is from SOUNDCLOUD.  
- 12.54am, just added an easter egg on my projects page as it is empty and pretty ugly. i wanted to go with the "Youre not supposed to be here" filling the entire page in blood red ... but i thought that was pretty demonic so i opted out for a nice meme cause everyone loves memes :).
- daaaaaaaaaaaaang. this entry is from my desktop. i have learnt how to push and pull repositories so that my projects are all up to date on all of my devices. this is actually really cool. i can seriously jump out of my workstation whenever im stuck on a problem, bring my laptop with me for a walk or drive, and then get back to work as soon as i think of a fresh solution. pretty excited to see what lies ahead. i consider this quite a stepping stone in good development.
- sweet, it is. i was fumbling around trying to link up GitHub with Atom on OSX and it finally works. i can now have the freedom of working on my projects both portably and not. i have the freedom of stretching my legs away from my workstation and bringing my laptop to a park or coffee shop or something and resume as if nothing has happened. this is all preparation for a car service that is overdue that i have to go around doing today. at least then i feel like im being productive. its 12.25am right now and i can rest easy knowing that i have everything sorted. feelsgoodman.
- is this working??

17 Jan 2017 - I should really put in some notes for future self to reflect upon. So I'll start off here, 3 days or so after publishing this repo. The topest of kek.
- modified .htaccess file because it gave the website a 404 error. commented out the bad code and replaced it with another string of text. website is up again.
- included .htaccess file which helps to make the address bar links to .HTML and .PHP files look cleaner. So instead of ludwig.press/index.html , it is now ludwig.press/index
- made another blog entry
- was tinkering around new divs for the separation on paragraphs both on the contacts page and also the blog page. Trying to get the contact page to align correctly, but it seems like that's a little tough as of right now. I'll give it another try. But the separations for the blog page seems to be working as intended. Would like to see how it looks on mobile though.

First commit before 17 Jan 2017 -
- from memory, I can recall that I obviously published the site and uploaded all of the scripts and relevant files and images onto GitHub.
- in the days following first commit, I remember inputting content in all of the pages.
- I did remove the project page link though, needs more tinkering with linking my developer page and making it look 'pretty' or aesthetically pleasing and maybe a demo (if possible), before putting it up online.
- I also aligned the content on the index, blog and contact page so that it looks nice and neat. Before, it was pretty much all over the place and looks good only on my computer screen. Now, it looks better on both mobile and desktops, of all resolutions.
